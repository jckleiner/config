# IntelliJ Setup & Config

### Plugins to install
 * Eclipse code formatter
 * Lombok
 * BrowseWordAtCaret
    - Once a word is selected, you can switch between the highlights with `Option + CMD + Up/Down`
 * Sonar Lint
 * Codota
 * Maven Helper
 * Key Promoter X
 * Consolas and Consolas bold Font

### Be Aware
IntelliJ did not set the working directory path correctly for 2 modules inside a project. This led to the app not finding files (e.g. ../content/whitelabel/de/index).
The fix was to edit the run config -> Set the working directory again for each module.
 * Set the spring profiles for each project

### Intellij Cannot resolve symbol on import
 - Cannot resolve plugin org.apache.maven.plugins...
   - preferences -> build -> build tools -> maven -> enable "use plugin registry"
 * File -> Invalidate Caches/Restart
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26952078/intellij-cannot-resolve-symbol-on-import

### Generated source folders are not in classpath
1. Right click project folder > Select Maven > Select Generate Sources And Update Folders -> reload all maven project (invalidate cache if still not working)
2. (another option) Project Structure > Modules > Click the generated-sources folder and make it a sources folder.
3. (another option) you can define folders as "source folder" in pom.xml (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5170620/unable-to-use-intellij-with-a-generated-sources-folder)

### Import Settings
 * `File -> Manage IDE Settings -> Import Settings -> select intellijSettings.zip`
 * Notice: The font is sometimes NOT imported and IntelliJ sticks to its default font for some reason. This can be fixed either by manually selecting the correct font again or deleting the `editor-font.xml` file in `~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/IdeaIC2021.3/options`. This forces IntellJ to use the correct fonts configured in `.../options/editor.xml`
 * Run Configurations also need to be exported separately if needed

Check the following points again:

 1. `File -> Project Structure -> Project` Check SDK Language-Level
 2. `File -> Project Structure -> Facet` Check if modules are automatically recognized as Spring-Modules, if not add them manually
 3. `File -> Settings -> Editor -> File Encoding UTF-8` set as Global Encoding setting, (also for .propeties Files)
 4. `File -> Settings -> Editor`
    * Code Style Line separator -> Unix and OS X.
    * Deselect `Detect and use existing file indents for editing`
 5. cog wheel symbol at the top right corner of project preview -> always select opened file

If the config should be extracted from an Eclipse preferences file (Eclipse code formatter is needed):

Code Style: 
 * `IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences -> Eclipse Code Formatter -> Eclipse Formatter Config -> Browse -> xyzConfig.xml`
 * Select the wanted profile under `Java formatter profile`

Import Order:
 * `IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences -> Eclipse Code Formatter -> Import order -> Browse -> xyz.importorder`


#### Change Keyboard Shortcuts
 * `Preferences -> keymap -> code - reformat code -> ALT+F`

#### Autoformat with Macro
 1. Edit -> Macros -> start recording macro -> ALT+F -> edit -> macros -> stop recording -> give it a name
 2. Preferences -> Keymap -> Macros -> name of the macro -> click and add to keyboard shortcut

#### Multiple Maven Projects in the same workspace
 * at the right side of the window there is a "maven" column -> + icon -> select pom.xml

#### Code style
 * Font: consolas
 * Size: 14
 * Line Spacing: 1.1

#### System Font
 * `Preferences -> Appearance -> Appearance -> use custom font -> .SF NS Text 13`
 * `Preferences -> Editor -> Color scheme -> console font -> Consolas 13`

#### Themes
 * "Atom One Theme" is cool but needs some adjustments
#### Enable Lombok
 * `Preferences -> Build... -> Compiler -> Enable annotation processing`
 * `Preferences -> Plugins -> install lombok plugin -> restart`

#### Version control file status color
 * `Settings/Preferences -> Version Control -> File Status Colors`

#### Hide Files
 * `Preferences -> Editor -> File Types -> *.iml;*.idea;`

#### Create workspace with multiple maven projects in it
* IntelliJ welcome screen -> create new project -> empty project
* File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> import module -> select pom.xml

#### IntelliJ Terminology
Project -> Workspace
Module -> Project or Submodule inside a 'Project'

#### Import folder into workspace with multiple maven projects in it
 1. IntelliJ welcome screen -> open or import -> select folder
 2. File -> Project Structure -> Project
      * Check Project Name
      * Check Project SDK
      * Check Project Language Level

Keep the root folder as a parent 'IntelliJ-Module' with mutliple projects under it as 'submodules':
 * File -> Project Structure -> Modules
   * right click on the 'root' module -> add -> import module -> select pom.xml file for each project
   * Add every project inside the root folder as a module

If the root folder should be hidden/removed from the workspace:
 * File -> Project Structure -> Modules
   * Remove the root folder from modules
   * Add every project inside the root folder as a module

## Hot Reload Spring Boot
 1. add devtools dependency
 2. Setting -> Build -> Compiler -> check Make project automatically.
 3. shift+cmd+a -> registry... -> compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running

 "update resources" vs "update classes and resource" for a spring module:
 If the second option is selected, on reload spring will not be able to find certain beans!

## Execute maven goals after/before a build/rebuild
When intellij builds the project, it only generates the byte code for the project. It DOES NOT generate a .jar file when you do a `Build -> Build/Rebuild Project`.
In order to assign mvn goals to this build trigger:
 1. On the right hand side, click `Maven`
 2. Select a Lifecycle or Plugin goal to be executed before/after a build/rebuild

### IntelliJ not detecting maven project
Close or switch to another projetc. Open the project files, delete the `.idea` folder and then open the maven project again.

### Auto commenting line has a weird indentation
Preferences >> Editor >> Code Style >> java >> Under "Comment Code" only enable "Add space..." 
Preferences >> Editor >> Code Style >> HTML + XML >> Code Generation >> disable both boxes

### Remove unused imports automatically
Editor > General > Auto Import > check "optimize imports on the fly"


## IntelliJ CE
 * There are services tab: `view > tool windows > services` but there are no "Spring Boot" run config type
 * You can use "Application" as a Run Configuration Type to list available applications

### Intellij keeps closing tabs
Select File -> Settings -> Editor -> General -> Editor Tabs
Look for "Tab Closing Policy" -> Tab Limit and change the value to a higher integer

## Useful Keybindings
 * cmd + shift + T     Open last closed file
 * cmd + shift + E     Open recents
 * cmd + shift + X     Fold all blocks
 * cmd + shift + C     Unfold all blocks

## Things added to the settings (2022-07-02)
 * Remove the name of the author: Inlay hints -> Code vision -> Code author
 * Remove usages hint: Inlay hints -> Code visionn -> Usages
 * Editor -> Code style -> Java -> Enum Constants, Class/Method/Field/LocalVariable annotations -> Always wrap
 * Keybindings for folding and opening blocks
   * cmd + shift + E     Open recents
   * cmd + shift + X     Fold all blocks
   * cmd + shift + C     Unfold all blocks

## TODO

 * Opening a new project (in a new window) results in some configuration to be lost?
      How can I configure IntelliJ globally?
 * Log font size and line wrapping
 * Some settings are not migrated over when creating a new project? Why?
 * Import order not working?
 * Move between tabs with CMD + arrow keys
 * Upload settings to github, can export + push to github be automated?
 * HTML formatting, attributes 2 tabs without spaces to align them
 * Take a look at hot reload, trigger it only with a shortcut? Fix the low activation time
      - Disabled `Compiler -> Build project automatically`
      - Now a hot reload happens only when I build the project manually, with `CMD + b`
 * It still builds automatically when an error is presen??
 * APPLICATION FAILED TO START, on hot reload
