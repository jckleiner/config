# Obsidian Configuration

Note that **every Obsidian vault has it's own `.obsidian` folder inside it** which contains the configuration.
This gets messy when you have multiplt vaults, since you need to somehow synchronize the configuration between them.

 1. Change to the folder of the new vault
 2. Call my custom bash function `obsidian_symlink_config` to create the symlinks
