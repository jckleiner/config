  - Code coverage expand lines: 
      System Preferences > editor > Color Scheme > General > Line Coverage
      Only check "Background" with the color you want, uncheck "Bold" and "Foreground"
      
### iTerm2 
  - TODO: faster scrolling, jumping to different words without pressing arrow for 5 minutes
  - shortcut for opening a new terminal / focusing existing: `iTerm2 -> Preferences -> Keys -> Hotkey -> CTRL + ALT + T`
  - Preferences -> Profiles -> Colors -> Light Background
  - Preferences -> Profiles -> Keys -> left option key -> Esc+
  - Shortcuts:
      ⌘ + up/left/down/right  -> move between windows and tabs
      ⌘ + D                   -> Split pane vertically
      ⌘ + shift + D           -> Split pane horizontally
      ctrl + ⌘ + T            -> Open Terminal / toggle open terminal window

### Open a terminal in Finder
  `Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services -> new iTerm2 window here -> CMD + Shift + 1
  Select a file or folder, press shortcut`

### Open files with .xyz file endings with a particular app (i.e. vscode)
  Right click on file -> get info -> open with change -> select program -> click 'change all'

### Enable syntax higlighting for vi and nano 
  **vim**
  `echo "syntax on" >> ~/.vimrc`

  **nano**
  `brew install nano`
  Brew will install many files for different formats under `/usr/local/share/nano`

  We can inclide ALL syntax highlight colors for our user:
  * `nano ~/.nanorc`
  * add `include "/usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc"`


  **change syntax highlighting colors for nano**

  Go to the `/usr/share/nano` (Linux) or `/usr/local/share/nano` (Mac) directory and check out the `*.nanorc` files there. For example, to change the comment color in PHP, edit `/usr/share/nano/php.nanorc` and change:

      color brightblue start="/\*" end="\*/"
          to
      color red start="/\*" end="\*/"

  Which files to import can be controlled in `~/.nanorc` for an individual user.

### Mac Fucked up Keyboard layout, switch `"` and `<` 
  The fix for this is to run the Keyboard Setup Assistant again. Sometimes there is a button for "Change Keyboard Type" visible in "System Preferences/Keyboard".

  1. If not, you can try trashing the file `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist` and restarting your machine.
  2. Before restarting try opening Terminal and type: `sudo open /System/Library/CoreServices/KeyboardSetupAssistant.app/Contents/MacOS/KeyboardSetupAssistant`
  3. Somethimes 2. also doesn't work, so a system reboot is needed.....................

### EN-US keyboard layout on MAC
  The tilde `~` is normally below the escape key. But for some reason, on a Mac, that is next to Shift. The button on the laptop's keyboard, where `~` normally is, on Mac it writes `§`.
  To use the original US layout on an EXTERNAL EU Keyboard (big enter): `keyboard -> change keyboard type -> american layout`

### Apache Server (MAC)
  I've installed apache somehow, I dont remember how.

  Normally the DocumentRoot is `/usr/local/var/www`
  But I've changed it to: `DocumentRoot "/Users/kleiner/develop/"` (Listen 80)

  ```
  /Users/kleiner/develop/index.html -> This is called on 'localhost:80'
  /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf.d/vhosts.conf -> has all the local endpoints like phpmyadmin (8008), typo3 (7007)
  ```

  Apache CONF: `/usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf`

  To have launchd start httpd now and restart at login: `brew services start httpd`

  Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run: `apachectl start`

  Start/Stop APACHE:
  * `sudo apachectl start`
  * `sudo apachectl restart`
  * `sudo apachectl stop`

  Error Log: `tail -f /usr/local/var/log/httpd/error_log`

### Phpmyadmin
  root:root
  Downloaded and extracted phpmyadmin to `/Users/kleiner/develop/phpmyadmin/`. I did not install anything else on the system with brew.

#### How to access remote server or a different port with local phpMyAdmin client? 
  By default phpmyadmin accesses localhost (port 3306)
  
  1. Go to phpmyadmin dir (default: `/etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php`, in my case: `/Users/kleiner/develop/phpmyadmin/`)
  2. There is a `config.sample.inc.php`, either rename or create a copy it with the name `config.inc.php`
  3. Add the following lines (when you login, at the top left it says `localhost:3306` now. Before it was just `localhost`)
  
  ```php
    /* 
      IMPORTANT: don't add $cfg['Servers'][$i]['port']
      add the port number after the host name, if non given it will be 3306
    */
    $i++;
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = 'HostName:port'; //provide hostname and port if other than default
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'userName';   //user name for your remote server
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'Password';  //password
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'config'; // keep it as config
  ``` 


### MySQL 5.7 (default port 3306)
  root:root


### `defaults`

`defaults` is a tool which lets you set the preferences for your system and third party programs from the command line.
Generally, programs generate a `<name>.plist` file in `~/Library/Preferences` where they save all the preferences.
This file can be either in a binary format or xml format. 

If the plist file is in the XML format, you can edit it in any text editor like TextEdit. If the plist file is in the binary format, you can convert it to XML first by running:

* `plutil -convert xml1 file.plist`

If you want to go back to binary format after editing:

* `plutil -convert binary1 file.plist`

Changing a preference: 

*  `defaults write com.apple.menuextra.battery ShowTime -string "YES"`
*  `defaults write -currentHost com.apple.menuextra.battery ShowTime -string "YES"`

Writing where?

 * `defaults write` seems to write to `~/Library/Preferences`
 * `defaults write -currentHost` does change that file, but not sure where it writes to. TODO


#### Cached Preferences 

Since 10.9, the OS caches your preferences. To invalidate the cache, you need to kill `cfprefsd`. 
So, first, set your preference via defaults then run this command:

* `killall -u $USER cfprefsd`

After that, your preference should take without needing a restart or anything else.
If preferences are set before opening the newly installed program, then it works fine.
Also if you restart then the preferences should be updated (didn't test it).

#### Launch at Login
  TODO: This seems to not update the specific app preference file. It probably updates a system preferences file somewhere.

#### System Preferences
  * See notes

#### Dock
  * add icons of newly installed programs to dock
  * make dock smaller
  * show open programs under app icon (with a dot)

#### Itsycal
  1. install
  4. configure
    *  `defaults write com.mowglii.ItsycalApp.plist ClockFormat -string "H:mm - EEEE, dd.MMMM"`
    *  `defaults write com.mowglii.ItsycalApp.plist HideIcon -bool true`
    *  `defaults write com.mowglii.ItsycalApp.plist HighlightedDOWs -int 65`
    * TODO launch at login

#### Alfred
  * Start Alfred and do the setup steps manually
  * System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Spotlight > Disable both
  * Set cmd space as the key combination in alfred
  * Change theme to 'Alfred Modern'

### Firefox
  - Change theme to white: Preferences -> Extension and themes -> Light
  - Disable search suggestions: Preferences -> Search -> Search Suggestions (disable)
  - Url autocomplete: `about:config` -> browser.urlbar.autoFill -> true
  - Import bookmarks: Shift + Command + B -> Up/Down icon
  - Make Firefox the default browser: Preferences -> General
  - Display bookmark bar always: right click next to url bar -> bookmarks toolbar -> always show
  - Open tab not at the end of the bar but after currently open tab: about:config -> 'curr' -> .insertAfterCurrent and .insertRelatedAfterCurrent true
  - Change lang to Eng
  - Addons:
      - KeePassXC-Browser
      - Adblocker

### Change unused keys Ğ Ş Ç
  * Ğ -> ( (shift) { (alt) [
  * Ü -> ) (shift) } (alt) ]
  * Ç -> / (shift) ~

#### KeepassXC Settings and Browser Integration
  * TODO: TouchID ??? -> if fixed then lock database when screen is locked
  * Security -> Convenience -> uncheck "lock databases when..." and "forget touchId when..."
  * Download extension "KeePassXC-Browser"
  * The database needs to be open on the background
  * URL field needs to be filled in order for the extension to retrieve the credentials automatically
  * More URL's for an entry can be set under "Browser Integration -> Additional URL's" 
  * For URL's to trigger DB access, only the domain needs to be matched. 
    So type https://myCompany.com and this will be enough for all the sites with different subdomains, https://confluence.myCompany.com etc.

#### Time Machine
  * Plugin unused external ssd -> start timemachine
